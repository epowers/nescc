To build nesC: in this directory
./configure TOSDIR=<location of your TinyOS tos directory>
  (note: if you don't specify TOSDIR, configure will try and find a directory
         named ../tos, then ../../tos, then $HOME/nest/tos before failing)
make

To install:
make install

To install a nesC editor mode (currently, emacs, vim, kde):
Read <installdir>/lib/ncc/editor-modes/<your-editor-name>/readme.txt
