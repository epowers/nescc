To build nesC: in this directory
./configure [--prefix=<where you want to install nesc]
make

To install:
make install

To install a nesC editor mode (currently, emacs, vim, kde):
Read <installdir>/lib/ncc/editor-modes/<your-editor-name>/readme.txt

To use nesC with TinyOS, you need to install the ncc, mig, etc TinyOS
frontends for nesC. These are found in tinyos-1.x/tools/src/ncc (for TinyOS
1.x) and in tinyos-2.x/tools (for TinyOS 2.x). Please follow the
installation directions you find there.

To use nesC with the Atmel AVR processors or the TI MSP processors you
need the avr-gcc and msp430-gcc packages, as well as patched versions
of the GNU binutils (avr-binutils and msp430-bintutils respectively).
These packages can be obtained from http://www.tinyos.net/dist-2.0.0 
(also check http://www.tinyos.net/download.html to see if newer versions
are available).
