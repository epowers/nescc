Limitations and known bugs in galsC 0.1 release:

- Generated code may not compile or warnings may be generated if the
galsC source code contains any of the following:
  - parameters whose GET() functions are connected to unused functions.
  - ports whose GET() and PUT() functions are connected to unused functions.

- Type checker does not currently check the command/event type for a
parameter GET connection.

- TinyGUYS PUT call may not be generated before call to another
connected function.  
        Example: [f -> l], [f -> f].  
The first call should be generated first.

- Cycles around actors should be allowed (currently flagged as an
error by the type checker).

- nesC concurrency checker has not beed updated to reflect lack of
race conditions and port boundaries.

- Global parameter access is not currently allowed.  
        Example: [(p, g) -> p] in an application file.

- Function names are not allowed in the actorControl list (only whole
interfaces allowed).

- Parameterised interfaces may not work in actorControl list.

- Multiple functions may connect to an input or output port.

- Multiple ports may connect to a port.

- Parameterised ports allowed in grammar, but not implemented in compiler.

- Queue sizes must be determined heuristically (trial and error).

- nesdoc (documentation generator) does not work.

- TOSSIM/nido (make pc) does not work.

- Only one external component ("Main") is currently allowed.

===========================================================================
The following types of connections exist 
  (+ means tested, - is the format tested):

application:
+ p -> p
+ g = l
+ l = g
  (p, g) -> p
  p -> g
  (p, g) -> gx

actor:
  p -> p
+ p -> f
+ f -> p
+ f -> f 
  - [i -> i]
  (p, l) -> p
+ (f, l) -> p 
  - [(arg, l) -> f]
+ (p, l) -> f 
  - [(empty, l) -> f]
+ (f, l) -> f
  p -> l
+ f -> l
  (p, l) -> l
  (f, l) -> l
