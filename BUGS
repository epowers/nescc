Limitations and known bugs in galsC 0.1 release:

- Type checker does not currently check the command/event type for a
parameter GET connection.

- TinyGUYS PUT call may not be generated before call to another
connected function.  
        Example: [f -> l], [f -> f].  
The first call should be generated first.

- Cycles around actors should be allowed (currently flagged as an
error by the type checker).

- nesC concurrency checker has not beed updated to reflect lack of
race conditions and port boundaries.

- Global parameter access is not currently allowed.  
        Example: [(p, g) -> p] in an application file.

- Function names are not allowed in the actorControl list (only whole
interfaces allowed).

- Parameterised interfaces may not work in actorControl list.

- Multiple functions may connect to an input or output port.

- Multiple ports may connect to a port.

- Parameterised ports allowed in grammar, but not implemented in compiler.

- Queue sizes must be determined heuristically (trial and error).

- nesdoc (documentation generator) does not work.

- TOSSIM/nido (make pc) does not work.

- Only one external component ("Main") is currently allowed.
