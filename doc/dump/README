Schema for nesC XML dump information, written using the DSD schema language.

See http://www.brics.dk/DSD/ for documentation on this schema language
(which is simpler and cleaner than many alternatives...).

The top-level element is nesc, documenation on the XML elements is found 
in the dsd files themselves.

For information on how to generate XML output from the nesC compiler, see
the nescc man page and doc/user/attributes.txt (the doc directory is 
usually found in /usr/share/ncc).

Files:
nesc.dsd: main schema file. Defines nesc element and imports all other files.
regexps.dsd: regular expressions for attributes (includes constants, which
  are encoded as attribute values).
attributes.dsd: many of the attributes have a fixed format irrespective of
  the element in which they are found. These rules are defined here.
common.dsd: some common elements.
basic.dsd: elements for references, types, attributes and initialisers
  (aka structured values)
cobject.dsd: elements for C-related objects (variables, typedefs, etc)
component.dsd, interfacedef.dsd, tag.dsd, wiring.dsd: elements for 
  corresponding XML elements.
